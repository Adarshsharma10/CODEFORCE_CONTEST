This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces contest problems, primarily written in C++.

The code here is focused on getting AC during contests, so some solutions may be rushed, compact, or not fully optimized. Cleanups or improvements may be added later.

Purpose

Practice competitive programming

Improve problem-solving speed

Track progress across contests

Notes

Contest-style code (readability is secondary)

Solutions reflect my own attempts

Not all solutions are editorial-level
